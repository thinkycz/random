# Project Status

## Current Date/Session Summary
**Date:** March 21, 2026

**Summary:** Fixed the timezone bug where "today" used the server's timezone. Users can now select their timezone in their profile settings. The dashboard, habit completion toggle, and streak calculation now all respect the user's selected timezone.

## What has been completed
- Installed Laravel Breeze and configured authentication (Blade/Tailwind).
- Defined the product concept as a Habit Tracker.
- Created database models, migrations, factories, and seeders for Categories, Habits, and Habit Completions.
- Built a dashboard showing "Today's Habits" with a 1-click completion toggle.
- Built CRUD interfaces for Habits and Categories.
- Added basic feature tests for Habit and Category flows.
- Established persistent tracking files and documentation.
- Implemented a responsive 7-day Weekly View on the dashboard.
- Implemented current and longest streak calculations and displayed them on the Habits index page.
- Added user timezone selection in profile settings and used it to correctly determine "today" across the application.

## What is in progress
- None.

## Known Issues
- If a category is deleted, habits associated with it lose the category but still remain. This behavior is intentional for now but needs clearer UI messaging in the future.

## Next Recommended Tasks
- **Refactoring:** Extract completion logic into a dedicated Service or Action class if it grows more complex.
- **Data Visualization:** Add a simple chart to the dashboard showing completion percentages over the last 30 days.

## Technical Debt Notes
- UI empty states are basic text; they could benefit from simple illustrations or icons.

## Test Coverage Notes
- Basic feature tests cover:
  - Viewing categories.
  - Creating categories.
  - Viewing habits on the dashboard.
  - Creating habits.
  - Toggling habit completions.
  - Asserting users cannot view/edit others' data (authorization).
  - Timezone respects for toggling completions and calculating dates.
- Test coverage is moderate.

## Setup or Environment Notes
- **Database:** SQLite is used locally.
- **Frontend:** Requires Node.js (`npm install && npm run build`).
- Ensure `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` is run to populate realistic fake data.
