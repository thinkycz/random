# Project Status

## Current Date/Session Summary
**Date:** April 19, 2026

**Summary:** Resolved the timezone bug by adding a timezone field to the user profile. The application now uses the user's local timezone instead of the server's UTC timezone to determine "today" boundaries, ensuring habits are toggled and streaks are calculated accurately across different global locations.

## What has been completed
- Installed Laravel Breeze and configured authentication (Blade/Tailwind).
- Defined the product concept as a Habit Tracker.
- Created database models, migrations, factories, and seeders for Categories, Habits, and Habit Completions.
- Built a dashboard showing "Today's Habits" with a 1-click completion toggle.
- Built CRUD interfaces for Habits and Categories.
- Added basic feature tests for Habit and Category flows.
- Established persistent tracking files and documentation.
- Implemented a responsive 7-day Weekly View on the dashboard.
- Implemented current and longest streak calculations and displayed them on the Habits index page.
- **Added a 'timezone' field to users and refactored Habit models/controllers to respect user's local timezone.**

## What is in progress
- None.

## Known Issues
- If a category is deleted, habits associated with it lose the category but still remain. This behavior is intentional for now but needs clearer UI messaging in the future.

## Next Recommended Tasks
- **Refactoring:** Extract completion logic into a dedicated Service or Action class if it grows more complex.
- **Data Visualization:** Add a simple chart to the dashboard showing completion percentages over the last 30 days.
- **Habit Archiving:** Allow users to hide a habit without deleting its history.

## Technical Debt Notes
- UI empty states are basic text; they could benefit from simple illustrations or icons.

## Test Coverage Notes
- Basic feature tests cover:
  - Viewing categories.
  - Creating categories.
  - Viewing habits on the dashboard.
  - Creating habits.
  - Toggling habit completions.
  - Asserting users cannot view/edit others' data (authorization).
- Test coverage is moderate. Edge cases, like timezone issues, are not yet tested.

## Setup or Environment Notes
- **Database:** SQLite is used locally.
- **Frontend:** Requires Node.js (`npm install && npm run build`).
- Ensure `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` is run to populate realistic fake data.
